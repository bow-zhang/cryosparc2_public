Admin users can see all projects. Users can be limited to browse only particular directories.</li>\n<li>Several UI updates and improvements, filters and searchability for projects and workspaces</li>\n<li>Downsample particles job can now also highpass and lowpass filter particle images</li>\n<li>New installation and configuration commands</li>\n<li>Bug fixes to enable SLURM and other cluster schedulers</li>\n</ul>",
